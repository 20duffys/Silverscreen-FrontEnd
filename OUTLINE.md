Project Two outline:

##SilverScreen

###Description

A website which helps you to find the best movie to watch. Using *The New York Times*'s API Movie Review section and OMDB API, SilverScreen will display all of the necessary information in order to convince you or dissuade you from viewing any movie.

###Minimum Viable Product

I would like to have a working app which allows the user to enter the name of any movie and return: the title, the director, rotten tomatoes rating, and the New York Times Movie Review(s). If the movie is liked, it would go into a save folder called "My Hit List." I'd like to have this along with a killer CSS.

###Add ons

- Moving backgrounds being gifs from the movie's trailer
- Access to the Fandango API to show local theaters
- Google Maps to show where those theaters are.

###Plan

- Wed:
  - Setup GitHub Repository
  - Figure out what the project is going to be.
- Thur:
  - Establish all necessary pages and files. (look at Marvel example)
  - Get response from IMDB (easy) and NYT (api) on the front-end first. (to see if it works)
  - Display response data onto the page.
  - Establish rudimentary backend with "like" button.
- Fri:
  - Continue work of Thur (hopefully won't be a problem).
  - work the Fandango API
  - or work the google maps API to find nearest theater.
- Sat:
  - styling day
  - publish

###result
- My plan didn't work out as I wanted to. I had great difficult assimilating alot of the data, including the APIs. I was able to access both APIs. I was also able to append them to the page. I was able to access Hiroku, but not in time to make an adequate back-end. I will be working on that. Overall, I'm really glad I did this project and I look forward to perfecting it soon.
